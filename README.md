## Overview

This student project focuses on developing a believable first-person shooter (FPS) artificial intelligence (AI) using behavior trees in Unreal Engine. The AI characters demonstrate realistic behaviors and responses to the player's actions. To enhance the player's experience and immersion, sound quips have been added to the AI, providing auditory cues that indicate the AI's current thoughts or intentions. The goal was to recreate something similar to what is found in the F.E.A.R. games.

## Timeline
This project took roughly 1 week. It was done for a class as a part of my bachelors degree.

## Features

- **Believable AI**: Using behavior trees, the AI characters display dynamic and realistic behaviors within the game environment. They will react to seeing and hearing the player. The AI will react to each other, when the player is spotted.
- **Sound Quips**: The AI characters vocalize their thoughts, giving the player insight into their decision-making process and current actions.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository and open the project in Unreal Engine.
2. Navigate to the main game level and hit the "Play" button.
3. Try to eliminate the AI characters, observing their behaviors and listening to their sound quips to gain a better understanding of their intentions and decision-making processes.

## Future Improvements

- Improve the variety and complexity of AI behaviors by expanding the behavior trees.
- Add more sound quips to cover a broader range of AI thoughts and actions.
- Enhance the AI's responsiveness to the player's actions, further improving the believability of their behavior.
